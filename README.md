# vue-demo-project

This is simple js project written using Vue 2 framework
The application is a todo page. 
We can add new todo, mark a todo as completed, view list of all, completed or uncompleted todos using the filter. There are home page on the localhost:(port 8080 or 8081)/, and todo list on the localhost:(port 8080 or 8081)/todos.

The application was written to familiarize yourself with the Vue framework, understanding what a component is; creating data, passing data to components, iterating v-for arrays, validating parameters, working with styles, dynamic classes, adding events, working with methods, forms; working with v-models, lifecycle (mounted), working with a server, multi-page with Vue Router, how v-if works, adding a loader component, filters, Computed properties.
